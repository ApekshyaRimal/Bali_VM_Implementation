# Extending the Bali Interpreter to include more language features

# What do you want to do as a course project?
We want to extend Bali Interpreter to include other language features as our course project. We plan to add programming language features such:
* Array
* For-each loop
* Type system
* Do-while
* Switch-case

Leveraging the experience from implementing for-loop in homework 3, our approach will be to start small by implementing similar features such as for-each (after implementing array) and then taking it further to the language features listed above. We will be using SAM as our virtual machine. Consequently, we will be generating *.asm files which will be executed on the Sam virtual machine.
